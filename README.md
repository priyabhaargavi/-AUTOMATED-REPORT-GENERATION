**The project will involve designing and creating a Python application that takes input data from a CSV file, calculates statistical measures, and outputs a detailed report in PDF. The application will use the ReportLab and FPDF libraries to produce a well-formatted report that summarizes the major statistics of the input data.

To meet this objective, the application will be required to take input data from a user-defined CSV file. It will thereafter carry out statistical computations on the input data such as determining the maximum value, minimum value, standard deviation, and percentage calculation against a user-defined reference value. After carrying out the calculations, the application will create a PDF report presenting the important statistics of the input data.

The application will be developed on Python 3.x and will employ a number of libraries to get the desired functionality. Pandas library will be employed for manipulation of CSV data, while ReportLab and FPDF libraries will be employed to generate PDF reports. The matplotlib or seaborn library might also be employed for optional charting. The application will take a CSV file input and will produce a PDF report as output.

The PDF report that the application produces will contain a number of important elements. A summary table will be provided to show the computed statistical values, while a detailed table will be provided to show the original input values. There will also be an optional chart or graph to represent the data. A report title page bearing the date will also be attached to it.
A footnote having page numbers will also accompany the report along with a notice declaring copyright over its contents.

The application will also permit users to personalize the report layout, font, and colors. This will permit users to customize the report to meet their needs and preferences. In general, the application will offer a valuable tool for data analysis and reporting, and will permit users to easily and quickly create professional-quality reports.**
